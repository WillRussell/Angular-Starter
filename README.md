# About: 

A seed project for spinning up a static web app with AngularJS. This project is wired up with a stack of dependencies I commonly use to build single-page apps with. 


# Run the app locally: 

`git clone`

`cd angular-start`

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

 Nav to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser
